## Fundamental Principles of Interaction

Great designers produce pleasurable experiences. *Experience*: note
the word. Engineers tend not to like it; it is too subjective.

Experience is critical, for it determines how fondly people remember their
interactions. Was the overall experience positive, or was it frustrating and
confusing? When our home technology behaves in an uninterpretable fashion we
can become confused, frustrated, and even angry—all strong negative emotions.
When there is understanding it can lead to a feeling of control, of mastery, and
of satisfaction or even pride—all strong positive emotions. Cognition and emotion
are tightly intertwined, which means that the designers must design with both in mind. 

When we interact with a product, we need to figure out how to work it. This
means discovering what it does, how it works, and what operations are possible:
discoverability. Discoverability results from appropriate application of five
fundamental psychological concepts covered in the next few chapters: affordances,
signifiers, constraints, mappings, and feedback. But there is a sixth principle,
perhaps most important of all: the conceptual model of the system.
It is the conceptual model that provides true understanding. So I now turn to
these fundamental principles, starting with affordances, signifiers, mappings,
and feedback, then moving to conceptual models.

### Affordances 

We live in a world filled with objects, many natural, the rest artificial.
Every day we encounter thousands of objects, many of them new to us. Many of
the new objects are similar to ones we already know, but many are unique,
yet we manage quite well. How do we do this? Why is it that when we encounter
many unusual natural objects, we know how to interact with them? Why is this
true with many of the artificial, human-made objects we encounter? The answer
lies with a few basic principles. Some of the most important of these principles
come from a consideration of affordances.

The term affordance refers to the relationship between a physical object and a
person (or for that matter, any interacting agent, whether animal or human, or
even machines and robots). An affordance is a relationship between the properties
of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object
could possibly be used. A chair affords (“is for”) support and, therefore,
affords sitting. Most chairs can also be carried by a single person
(they afford lifting), but some can only be lifted by a strong person or by a
team of people. If young or relatively weak people cannot lift a chair,
then for these people, the chair does not have that affordance, it does not
afford lifting.

The presence of an affordance is jointly determined by the qualities of the object
and the abilities of the agent that is interacting.  We are used to thinking that
properties are associated with objects. But affordance is not a property. An affordance
is a relationship. Whether an affordance exists depends upon the properties of both
the object and the agent.

Glass affords transparency. At the same time, its physical structure blocks the
passage of most physical objects. As a result, glass affords seeing through and
support, but not the passage of air or most physical objects
(atomic particles can pass through glass). The blockage of passage can be considered
an anti-affordance—the prevention of interaction. To be effective, affordances
and antiaffordances have to be discoverable—perceivable. This poses a
difficulty with glass.  The reason we like glass is its relative invisibility,
but this aspect, so useful in the normal window, also hides its anti-affordance
property of blocking passage. As a result, birds often try to fly through windows.
And every year, numerous people injure themselves when they walk (or run) through
closed glass doors or large picture windows.  If an affordance or anti-affordance
cannot be perceived, some means of signaling its presence is required: I call
this property a **signifier**.

Affordances exist even if they are not visible. For designers, their
visibility is critical: visible affordances provide strong clues to the
operations of things. A flat plate mounted on a door affords pushing. Knobs
afford turning, pushing, and pulling. Perceived affordances help people figure
out what actions are possible without the need for labels or instructions.
I call the signaling component of affordances signifiers.

Many people find affordances difficult to understand because they are
**relationships, not properties**. Designers deal with fixed properties,
so there is a temptation to say that the property is an affordance.

## SIGNIFIERS

Designers have practical problems. They need to know how to
design things to make them understandable. They soon discovered that when working with the graphical designs for electronic
displays, they needed a way to designate which parts could be
touched, slid upward, downward, or sideways, or tapped upon.
The actions could be done with a mouse, stylus, or fingers. Some
systems responded to body motions, gestures, and spoken words,
with no touching of any physical device. How could designers describe what they were doing? There was no word that fit, so they
took the closest existing word—affordance. Soon designers were
saying such things as, “I put an affordance there,” to describe why
they displayed a circle on a screen to indicate where the person
should touch, whether by mouse or by finger. “No,” I said, “that is not
an affordance. That is a way of communicating where the touch
should be. You are communicating where to do the touching: the affordance of touching exists on the entire screen: you are trying to
signify where the touch should take place. That’s not the same thing
as saying what action is possible.”

I decided to provide a better answer: signifiers. Affordances determine what
actions are possible. Signifiers communicate where the action should take place.
We need both.

People need some way of understanding the product or service
they wish to use, some sign of what it is for, what is happening,
and what the alternative actions are. People search for clues, for
any sign that might help them cope and understand. It is the sign
that is important, anything that might signify meaningful information.
Designers need to provide these clues. What people need, and
what designers must provide, are signifiers. 

The term signifier has had a long and illustrious career in the exotic field
of semiotics, the study of signs and symbols. But just as I appropriated affordance
to use in design in a manner somewhat different than its inventor had intended,
I use signifier in a somewhat different way than it is used in semiotics.
For me, the term signifier refers to any mark or sound, any perceivable indicator
that communicates appropriate behavior to a person.

Signifiers can be deliberate and intentional, such as the sign push on a door,
but they may also be accidental and unintentional, such as our use of the visible
trail made by previous people walking through a field or over a snow-covered terrain to
determine the best path. Or how we might use the presence or absence of people
waiting at a train station to determine whether we have missed the train.

FIGURE 1.2. Problem Doors: Signifiers Are Needed. Door hardware
can signal whether to push or pull without signs, but the hardware of the
two doors in the upper photo, A, are identical even though one should be
pushed, the other pulled. The flat, ribbed horizontal bar has the obvious
perceived affordance of pushing, but as the signs indicate, the door on the
left is to be pulled, the one on the right is to be pushed. In the bottom pair of
photos, B and C, there are no visible signifiers or affordances. How does one
know which side to push? Trial and error. When external signifiers—signs—
have to be added to something as simple as a door, it indicates bad design. 

Consider a bookmark, a deliberately placed signifier of one’s place in reading
a book. But the physical nature of books also makes a bookmark an accidental
signifier, for its placement also indicates how much of the book remains.
Most readers have learned to use this accidental signifier to aid in their
enjoyment of the reading. With few pages left, we know the end is near. Electronic
book readers do not have the physical structure of paper books, so unless the
software designer deliberately provides a clue, they do not convey any signal
about the amount of text remaining. -> Isto indica experiências diferentes com

FIGURE 1.3. Sliding Doors: Seldom Done Well. Sliding doors are seldom signified
properly. The top two photographs show the sliding door to the toilet on an Amtrak
train in the United States. The handle clearly signifies “pull,” but in fact, it needs to be
rotated and the door slid to the right. The owner of the store in Shanghai, China, Photo
C, solved the problem with a sign. “don’t push!” it says, in both English and Chinese.
Amtrak’s toilet door could have used a similar kind of sign.

FIGURE 1.4. The Sink That Would Not Drain: Where Signifiers Fail. I washed my
hands in my hotel sink in London, but then, as shown in Photo A, was left with the
question of how to empty the sink of the dirty water. I searched all over for a control:
none. I tried prying open the sink stopper with a spoon (Photo B): failure. I finally left
my hotel room and went to the front desk to ask for instructions. (Yes, I actually did.)
“Push down on the stopper,” I was told. Yes, it worked (Photos C and D). But how was
anyone to ever discover this? And why should I have to put my clean hands back into
the dirty water to empty the sink? The problem here is not just the lack of signifier, it is
the faulty decision to produce a stopper that requires people to dirty their clean hands
to use it.
