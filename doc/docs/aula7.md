Good design is actually a lot harder to notice than poor design, in part because
good designs fit our needs so well that the design is invisible, serving us
without drawing attention to itself. Bad design, on the other hand, screams out its
inadequacies, making itself very noticeable.

Logo, design é um trabalho que deve ser "invisível".

## Bad design

I push doors that are meant to be pulled, pull doors that should be
pushed, and walk into doors that neither pull nor push, but slide. Moreover,
I see others having the same troubles—unnecessary troubles. My problems with
doors have become so well known that confusing doors are often called
"Norman doors." [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7CpRH2WbME](

The design of the door should indicate how to work it without any need for
signs, certainly without any need for trial and error.

## Good design

Two of the most important characteristics of good design are
**discoverability and understanding**.

* Discoverability: Is it possible to even figure out what actions are possible
  and where and how to perform them?

* Understanding: What does it all mean? How is the product supposed to be used?
  What do all the different controls and settings mean?
  
* With complex devices, discoverability and understanding require the aid of
  manuals or personal instruction. We accept this if the device is indeed
  complex, but it should be unnecessary for simple things.
  
Design is concerned with how things work, how they are controlled, and the
nature of the interaction between people and technology. When done well,
the results are brilliant, pleasurable products. When done badly, the
products are unusable, leading to great frustration and irritation.
Or they might be usable, but force us to behave the way the product wishes
rather than as we wish.

It is time to reverse the situation: to cast the blame upon the machines
and their design. It is the machine and its design that are at fault. It
is the duty of machines and those who design them to understand people.
It is not our duty to understand the arbitrary, meaningless dictates of machines.

Engineers, moreover, make the mistake of thinking that logical explanation is
sufficient: “If only people would read the instructions,” they say,
“everything would be all right.” Engineers are trained to think logically.
As a result, they come to believe that all people must think this way, and
they design their machines accordingly. When people have trouble, the engineers
are upset, but often for the wrong reason. “What are these people doing?”
they will wonder. “Why are they doing that?” The problem with the designs of most
engineers is that they are too logical. We have to accept human behavior the way
it is, not the way we would wish it to be.
